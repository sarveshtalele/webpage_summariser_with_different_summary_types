       "1. **Establish a bedtime routine**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, including weekends.\n",
       "2. **Get 7-9 hours of sleep per night**: Aim for a consistent sleep schedule to regulate your body's internal clock.\n",
       "3. **Create a comfortable sleep environment**: Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine if necessary.\n",
       "4. **Avoid stimulating activities before bedtime**: Avoid screens (e.g., phones, tablets, or laptops), exercise, or caffeine-rich foods and drinks for at least an hour before bed.\n",
       "5. **Try relaxation techniques**: Engage in calming activities like reading, meditation, or deep breathing exercises to help you relax and fall asleep.\n",
       "6. **Limit naps during the day**: If you're having trouble sleeping, try to limit your daytime napping to 20-30 minutes and avoid napping close to bedtime.\n",
       "7. **Get some morning sunlight**: Exposure to natural light in the morning helps regulate your circadian rhythms, which can improve sleep quality.\n",
